                        Zed's gameplay is very flashy, clean and skillful. Being an assasin, his role in the game is to sneak up behind the enemy team and pick off their strongest members and escaping back to safety in order to come back and help his team win the fight from there. Zed is a character that is very special to me. I've been playing League of Legends for roughly 9 years now and Zed has been my favorite character to play 
                        for 8 of those years. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to lore, Zed is the leader of an organization he created called "The Order of Shadow". He wields shadow magic and expert martial artistry to quickly assasinate enemies.

                    <p>
                        Riot Games (developer of League of Legends) have announced that they are now developping a fighting game set in the League of Legends universe with league of Legends characters, but they have not announced the full roster yet, I am desprately hoping that Zed is a playable character in that game as I would definitely make him my main character.
