                    Zed's gameplay is very flashy, clean and skillful. Being an assasin type champion, his role in the game is to sneak up behind the enemy team, pick off their strongest members and escape back to safety in order to return and help his team win the fight from there. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to lore, Zed is the leader of an organization he created called "The Order of Shadow". He wields shadow magic and expert martial artistry to quickly assasinate enemies.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zed is a character that is really special to me. I've been playing League of Legends for roughly 9 years, and for atleast 7-8 of those years, Zed has been my main character. Crowds cheer when professional players choose him in tournament matches, many incredible highlight montage videos are made for this character. His style, gameplay and the prestige that I feel when I play him all comes together to make playing Zed an incredible experience.
