            I've been gaming for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest gaming memories was playing Lego
            Star Wars games on an old white bubble monitor computer when my age was still in the single digits, but when I was 10 years old I started playing 
            <abbr title="World of Warcraft"><strong>WoW</strong></abbr>. My best friend Jesse called my parents one night 
            and convinced them to pay for the 15<sup>$</sup>/month subsription so I could play with him, and I've been playing
            the game on and off ever since. Nowadays I mostly play <abbr title="League of Legends"><strong>LoL</strong></abbr>, <strong>Valorant</strong> and <abbr title="Guilty Gear Strive"><strong>GGST</strong></abbr>.

            This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> attempt at College. In 2017, I enrolled in the <em>Computer Technology Engineering</em> course and did it for 2 years,
            but I came to realize that the program was becoming too difficult and I did not want to pursue a career in the field. I worked full time as a 
            <em>Disaster Restoration Technician</em> for a couple years and now I am giving college another try.
